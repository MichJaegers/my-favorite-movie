        <p>imagine me and you is a romance movie made in the year 2005, but what makes it so special that I <strong> need </strong> to talk about it.</p>
         well it is because the movie is way out of its time, it's one of the first lesbian movies where neither of the women are unsure of their sexuality and just fall in love. 
         <p>so in short just beautiful romance between two very pretty women!</p></section>
